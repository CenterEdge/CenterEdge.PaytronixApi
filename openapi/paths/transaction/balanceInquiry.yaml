  summary: Request gift card balance information
  description: |
    A BalanceInquiry is used to request current balance information for a specified card in the Paytronix system.
    This is designed to provide information about both the stored value balance and some selected loyalty program
    information, if available, so the reply deals with all possible balance information. For pure stored value cards,
    only the stored value balance will be used.
