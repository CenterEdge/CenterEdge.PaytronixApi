  summary: Post a check and accrue points
  description: |
    The check post and accrue points request allows for a simplified one-step flow for posting a check for analysis and accruing points with one action,
     equivalent to using POST check/computePointAccrual.json to compute a point accrual Add/Redeem Request then submitting it via POST transaction/addRedeem.json
     and then submitting the check again via POST check/post.json.
     The only reason to use the multi-step flow is if the point accrual add/redeem needs to be tailored for special applications prior to submission.
