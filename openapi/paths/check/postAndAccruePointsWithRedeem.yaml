  summary: Post a check and accrue points with redeem
  description: |
    The check post and accrue points with redeem request is meant to follow a call to POST check/simulateAccrualAndRedemption.json,
    enabling you to choose the discounts that are applied. These will be passed in through the Check object.
    Its arguments are almost identical to the POST check/postAndAccruePointsWithAutoRedeem.json endpoint, merely requiring the addition of a receiptSettings object,
    and not needing the autoActivateCard argument. If successfull, it will return a receipt.
  operationId: checkPostAndAccrueWithRedeem
