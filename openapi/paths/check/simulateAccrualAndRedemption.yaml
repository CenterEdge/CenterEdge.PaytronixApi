  summary: Simulate posting a check with redemption
  description: |
    The check simulate accrual and redemption request is similar to the post and accrue points with auto-redeem request, 
    with the difference that no points or rewards are actually applied. 
    Instead, this endpoint takes in a check (with the same parameters as in the previous endpoint) and additionally a list of already applied rewards, 
    the manner in which rewards are to be selected (either automatic or manual and specified with the request), and the details of the receipt printer associated with the request. 
    If successful, it will return the applicable discounts (see DiscountItem), 
    a list of attempted rewards that cannot be applied (including any previously applied rewards that are no longer applicable) and a new receipt text.
